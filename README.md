Mad Lib

 A Mad Lib is a fun, interactive word game where players fill in blanks with specific types of words
(like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) to create a humorous or surprising story.
The structure of the story is pre-written, but key parts are left blank for the player to fill in
without knowing the full context. Once all the blanks are filled, the story is revealed,
often resulting in funny or unexpected outcomes.
