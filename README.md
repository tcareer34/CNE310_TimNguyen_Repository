# How it works:
# 1. The Setup: A short story is written with blanks where key words should be
#    (e.g., the name of a person, a place, or an action).
# 2. Prompting for Words: The player is asked to provide words to fill in the blanks without knowing the full story.
#    For example:
#       - "Give me a noun."
#       - "Give me an adjective."
#       - "Give me a verb."
# 3. Creating the Story: Once all the words are filled in, they are inserted into the story's template,
#    creating a unique and often humorous final story.
